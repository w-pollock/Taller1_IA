    To get started, you might want to try some of these simple commands to
    understand the search problem that is being passed in:

    print("Start:", problem.getStartState())
    print("Is the start a goal?", problem.isGoalState(problem.getStartState()))
    print("Start's successors:", problem.getSuccessors(problem.getStartState()))
